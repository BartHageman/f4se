# EXE Installer Setup

This folder contains a file that tells Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) how to create an installer executable. See a simple tutorial [here](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Simple_tutorials)
A .nsi file is an input to the process that creates an executable. You need the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System compiler. Get it [here](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)
